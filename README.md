# The Assumptions made for the assignment

1. I have assumed that I won't have to strip of the quotes for echo command.
2. I have assumed that the memory in pinfo is VSZ, i.e virtual memory size, and not RSS (resident size), since the brackets were mentioned so.
3. I assumed that the name of the exe is main. SO you are GONNA HAVE TO RUN ./main, not ./a.out after make.
4. This point is not for an assumption. This is just to thank the TA evaluating my shell.
